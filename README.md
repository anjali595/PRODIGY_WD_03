# PRODIGY_WD_03
This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to play against each other in a traditional grid format, where players take turns to place their marks ('X' or 'O') on the grid, aiming to get three markers in a row (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to win.
